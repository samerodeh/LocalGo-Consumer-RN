 *      order).
 *   2. Charge the card. The backend prices the cart itself — the totals in
 *      `input` are display values and are NOT what gets charged.
 *   3. Only then record the order locally, using the amounts Stripe actually
 *      took.
 *   4. Publish to the driver feed, with retries, because at this point the
 *      customer's money is gone and an order that never reaches a driver is
 *      the worst possible outcome.
 *
 * Uses `getState()` so it's callable outside React components.
