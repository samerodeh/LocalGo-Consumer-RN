"""LocalGO backend — Python/FastAPI.

One service backs BOTH React Native apps:
  * LocalGOConsumerRN — POST /orders (dispatch, with server-side delivery-
    location validation), the Goer chatbot (POST /goer/chat[/stream]),
    POST /notify.
  * LocalGODriverRN   — GET /orders/feed, POST /orders/{id}/accept,
    POST /orders/{id}/status, POST /notify.

It replaces the TypeScript/Deno Supabase edge functions (goer-chat,
notify-push) and the apps' direct PostgREST data access. Supabase stays as the
Postgres + Auth provider underneath; driver endpoints forward the caller's
Supabase Auth JWT so every RLS policy applies unchanged.

Run:  uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000   (from backend/)
