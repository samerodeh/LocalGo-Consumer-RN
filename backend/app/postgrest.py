"""Thin async helper over Supabase's PostgREST endpoint.

The backend is deliberately a *forwarding* proxy for data access: driver
endpoints pass the caller's own Supabase Auth JWT through to PostgREST, so
every row-level-security policy applies exactly as it did when the apps
talked to Supabase directly. The anon key is used where the consumer app used
it (the one-way order insert), and the service-role key only where the old
notify-push edge function used it (deriving push recipients).
