"""Stripe payments — the real authorize/capture that replaced the app's
simulated `setTimeout` in src/lib/placeOrder.ts.

Flow (the app drives it in this order):

  1. App generates the order id up front and POSTs the cart here as **item ids
     and quantities only** — no prices, no total.
  2. This module reprices the cart from the backend's own menu (`pricing.py`)
     and creates a PaymentIntent for that amount, stamping the breakdown and
     the order id into the intent's metadata.
  3. App presents Stripe's PaymentSheet with the returned client secret.
  4. On success the app calls POST /orders with the same order id and the
     payment intent id; `routers/orders.py` re-reads the intent from Stripe,
     confirms it actually succeeded, and takes the recorded amounts from the
     intent metadata rather than from the request body.

So the client never gets to name a price, and an order can't exist without a
matching succeeded charge. The `order_id` doubles as the Stripe idempotency
key, so a double tap reuses one intent instead of creating a second charge.

    The happy path doesn't need this — POST /orders verifies the intent

    before it calls /orders. Those charges would otherwise be money taken for an
    order no driver ever sees, with nothing anywhere recording it.

    On a successful payment this looks up the matching order row and logs an
    ORPHANED CHARGE line when there isn't one, so it can be refunded or
    completed by hand.

    RACE: Stripe often delivers this before the app's own POST /orders lands, so
    a freshly orphaned charge can be a false alarm that resolves itself seconds
    later. Always re-check the order id before refunding anything. Catching the
    genuine cases properly needs a periodic sweep over recent intents, not just
