"""Account deletion — required by Google Play for any app offering sign-up.

Policy implemented here (matches privacy-policy.html §7 and §9): the person is
erased, the transaction is kept. Orders survive as anonymized business records —
you need them for accounting, and the driver who delivered them has a legitimate
record too — but nothing on the row identifies the customer any more.

    orders          scrubbed: customer_id nulled, name and dropoff address
                    redacted. The row's money and timestamps stay.
    messages        the customer's own chat messages are deleted outright.
                    No FK, so nothing would have removed them otherwise.
    customers       deleted by cascade (FK to auth.users)
    push_tokens     deleted by cascade (FK to auth.users)
    auth.users      deleted last, via the Auth admin API
    AsyncStorage    cleared on the device by the caller (src/lib/account.ts)

Order matters: the scrub runs BEFORE the auth user is deleted. `orders.customer_id`
has no foreign key, so deleting the user first would leave rows pointing at a uid
that no longer exists — still personal data, now unreachable by this endpoint.
